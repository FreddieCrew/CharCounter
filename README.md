# CharCounter
Simple program written in C++ to count the characters inside a .txt file.

## Usage
1. Compile the main.cpp file
2. Place the .txt file(s) inside the "txt" folder
3. Then run the program

Useless and pointless? Yeah, I know, this program was created for the sole purpose of being an exercise.
